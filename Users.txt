//------------------------------------

the code used to create the table is
//------------------------------------
CREATE TABLE users(
  id int(11) not null PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name varchar(30) not null ,
  email varchar(128) not null ,
  password varchar(128) not null ,
  phoneNumber int(15) not null ,
  address varchar(300) not null
);
//---------------------------------------
what is needed to make this code work locally
1- create a database with the same information as the above one (same structure) I can include the above code.
2- go into the classes/db.class.php and edit the database information to match which ever local host you are using.
3- then it should all work also remember to add the project to your root folder of what ever service you are using.
make sure the table name is users in order to avoid heading into the classes/user.class.php and edit the sql queries.
